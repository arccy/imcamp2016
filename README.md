# Summer 2016 NTU IMCamp Site

_Unmaintained_

_This project is no longer in use and the [site](https://ntu.im/camp/2016/) now only serves the static pages_

This is the promotional/signup site for NTU IM's 2016 Summer Camp

## About
* This project is here for archival purposes.
* Nothing fancy, just a few static pages and a signup form.
* Mostly experiments in UX/UI and not-very-responsive design

## Setup
This is dirty code with all my configs inside.

This was set up as: Nginx (external) -> Apache -> Nginx -> uwsgi -> Django

Why? Because I was unaware Nginx was serving as the external reverse proxy server (now I am)

## Built with
* Django 1.9
* Skrollr
